# Intrusion-Detection

## Overview
This project is an **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** designed to monitor network traffic and detect potential malicious activities or unauthorized access. It uses machine learning techniques, such as Isolation Forest, and network packet analysis to identify anomalies in real-time.

## Features
- Real-time network traffic monitoring using `scapy`.
- Anomaly detection using the Isolation Forest algorithm.
- Email notifications for detected intrusions.
- Visualization of network activity using `matplotlib`.
- Modular and extensible design for adding new detection methods.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required Python libraries:
  - `scapy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `sklearn`
  - `numpy`
  - `requests`
